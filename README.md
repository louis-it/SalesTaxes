Within the solution there are many test cases, including those from the example paper. 
Running the main class will generate 3 .txt files corresponding to the receipts, and will open them with the default txt editor. 
The files will be placed in the default temporary folder (.../Appdata/Local/Temp in Windows, run 'open $TMPDIR' in Mac terminal to open the temp folder).

## Note: 
  I included a file 'Analysis.md' in the repository to explain my design choices.
